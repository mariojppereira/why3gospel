# Why3Gospel

[![OCaml-CI Build Status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fci.ocamllabs.io%2Fbadge%2Focaml-gospel%2Fwhy3gospel%2Fmaster&logo=ocaml)](https://ci.ocamllabs.io/github/ocaml-gospel/why3gospel)

**Disclamer:** This project is still experimental. No support will be provided
at this point, and its behaviour is still unstable.

Why3Gospel is a [Why3](http://why3.lri.fr/) plugin that enables the parsing of
[Gospel](https://github.com/ocaml-gospel/gospel) specifications and their
translation into Why3 interfaces. This enables refinement proofs from Why3
contracts to Gospel specifications within Why3.
